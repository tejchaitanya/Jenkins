master slave set up of jenkins
------------------------------
This is also known distributed jenkins build
when we want to run multiple jenkins jobs parallely it will effect the performance of the 
jenkins server 
The main machine the jenkins is configued is called as master 
we can create additional linux servers which will behave as slaves and then distribute the work load 
on to their slaves machines 

NOTE:master and slave should have same version of java installed and password less SSH connectivty should
be estlabished b/w master and slave 

setup for Master/slave 
---------------------
1.create a new ubuntu instance and name it as slave-1

2.connect to slave intance using git bash

3.update the apt-get repository and install java
	a)sudo apt-get update
	b)sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk
4.setup password less ssh b/w master and slave 
	 on slave
	-----------
	a)change the password for the default ubuntu user
		sudo passwd ubuntu
	b)edit sshd_config file
		sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
		search for "passwordAuthentication" and change it from no to yes
	c)after modifying the ssh_config we have to restart the service
		sudo service ssh restart
	on master 
	--------
	a)generate ssh keys
		ssh-keygen
	this will generate keys public and private keys

	b)copy the public keys
		ssh-copyid ubuntu@private_IP_OF_slave 
		this command will copy the connect of the public key and save in the slave machine
		in a file called "authorized_keys"



---------------------------------------------------- 
5.Download slave.jar into the slave instance
  
	connect to slave using git bash
        wget https://Private_ip_of_address_master:800/jnlpJars/slave.jar
6.By default every user having only read and write permission only,so we have to give execute permission
          $chmod u+x slave.jar

6.create a empty folder on the slave which will work like a workspace
	 $mkdir workspace
7.open dashboard of jenkins

8.click on managed nodes

10.click on new node----------->enter node name as slave1
   select permanant Agent---->ok
11.remote root directory
	/home/ubuntu/workspace
12.label we enter it as myslave
 
13.go to lauch method select "launch agent via execution of command on the master"
    ssh ubuntu@private_IP_OF_SLAVE  java -jar slave.jar
