Pipeline as code  :
=================

This is the process of implementing all the stages of CI/CD called as jenkins File
This jenkins file is created using grovy script
And it is uploaded into the remote version controlling system
from the remote version controlling system jenkins file will perform all the stages of CI/CD


Advantages:
----------
1.it requires minimum No of plugins so,it's generally more faster 

2.it can be instant planned and unplaned restats of the jenkins master

3.pipeline scripts support real time challenges like implementing conditional statements,exception handling etc 

4.since the jenkins files checked In into remote version controlling system ,it gives the team members ability to edit 
and review the code and still maintained multiple versions 

5.open source 

6.it contains 1000+ plugins 

7.easy to install

8.free of cost



pipeline as code can be implemted in two ways 
	1.scripted pipeline
	2.declarative pipeline



1.scripted pipeline
-------------------
node('master/slave')
{
	stage('stage name in CI-CD')
	{

		groovy code for implementing this stage

	}
}


Syntax of declarative pipeline
------------------------------
 
pipeline{

        agent any
        stages {

          stage('name of CI-CD')

            step{
		
		groovy script in CI-CD


            }
 }

}

----------------------------------------------
Scripted pipeline:
==================

node('master')
{
    stage('ContinuousDownload') 
    {
         git 'https://github.com/selenium-saikrishna/maven.git'
    }
    stage('ContinuousBuild') 
    {
         sh label: '', script: 'mvn package'
    }
    stage('ContinuousDeployment')
    {
        sh label: '', script: 'scp /home/ubuntu/.jenkins/workspace/ScriptedPipeline/webapp/target/webapp.war ubuntu@172.31.12.49:/var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/testenv.war'
    }
    stage('ContinuousTesting')
    {
        git 'https://github.com/selenium-saikrishna/FunctionalTesting.git'
        sh label: '', script: 'java -jar /home/ubuntu/.jenkins/workspace/ScriptedPipeline/testing.jar'
    }
     stage('ContinuousDelivery')
    {
        input message: 'Waiting for Approval from the DM', submitter: 'Srinivas'
        sh label: '', script: 'scp /home/ubuntu/.jenkins/workspace/ScriptedPipeline/webapp/target/webapp.war ubuntu@172.31.13.206:/var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/prodenv.war'
    }
    
    
}
