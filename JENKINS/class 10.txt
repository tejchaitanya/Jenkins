Multi brach Pipeline
----------------------
Developers upload multiple branches in github repository
Each branch containing a specific functionality code
along with that code developers will also place a copy of the jenkins file on each branch 
and this jenkins files will have instructions related to code present on that branch 

we should create a jenkins job which will read all this branches paralley and execute the instruction
present in these jenkins files

This concept is known as multi branch pipeline 


Developers activity
====================
1.Download Maven Project 
	git clone https://github.com/intelliqittraings/maven.git
2.move into this maven project and delete the .git folder
	cd maven
	rm -rf .git
3.initialise a new git repo and send the files into stagging area and local repo
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "a"

4.create a jenkinsfile on master branch and this files will have code related to master branch

5.create a new branch called loans and here also create a new jenkinsfile
 	git checkout loans
6.create a new repository on github--------->push all these branches into it
	git push origin --all



Devops Engineer activity
---------------------------
1.open the dashboard of the jenkins

2.create the job

3.enter some job name------->select multi branch pipeline----->ok

4.Go to branch sources --------->select git--------->enter github url where the code is uploaded

5.go to scan multibranch pipeline projects

6.check build periodically if not otherwise run --------->select the interval as one minute

7.click on save

Now if the developer makes changes to multiple branches code uploads into git hub jenkins will read al1 these branches and execute
the multiple jenkins file paralley
